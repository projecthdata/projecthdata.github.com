    <p>hData is a lightweight, web-based specification for exchanging electronic health data.</p>
    <div class="projectDescription"><h2>What is the objective of hData?</h2></div>
    <p>Current electronic health data standards are complex, hard to implement, and difficult to manage, especially for web centric and mobile developers. hData is a simple, flexible framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for efficient health IT technologies.</p>
	  <p>The hData specifications have been submitted to <a href="http://www.hl7.org/" >Health Layer 7 (HL7)</a> and and the <a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group (OMG)</a> for standadization. The hData Record Format is on the normative track at HL7 and has recently passed the DSTU ballot. More information can be found in the <a href="/standardization.html">Standardization</a> page. </p>
    <div class="projectDescription"><h2>What is the hData design philosophy?</h2></div>
    <img src="/images/hData-specs.png" width="300px" style="float:right" />
    <p>hData is designed for ease of implementation and improved efficiency by reducing the size of the data set, implementing a single way to represent data, and using standard web best practices. Crucial to achieving these design goals is a clear separation of content and exchange specifications. For this, the HL7 hData Record Format defines tbe concept of a hData Content Profile (HCP), which allows the specification for a detailed content model (including syntax, semantics, and behavioral models) for a given business use case. <p>
