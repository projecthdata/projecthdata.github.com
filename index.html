    <div class="projectDescription"><h2>What are the goals of hData?</h2></div>
    <p>Current electronic health data exchange standards are complex, hard to implement, and difficult to manage, especially for web centric and mobile developers. hData is a flexible web-oriented framework that addresses these issues and lays the foundation for efficient health information exchange. hData not only connects individuals to their health data, it also provides machine-to-machine data exchange.</p>
